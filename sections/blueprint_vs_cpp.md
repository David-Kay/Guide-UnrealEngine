**Choose C++** when you anticipate the need for interaction with other C++ code or require extensive control over low-level optimizations and memory management. C++ is well-suited for classes that require direct access to engine internals and efficient execution.

**Use Blueprint** as an inherited class when you want to benefit from the visual scripting capabilities and quick prototyping offered by Blueprint, while still having the option to incorporate C++ code in the future. This allows for a flexible approach where you can leverage the power of Blueprint while having the ability to extend functionality with C++ when needed.
