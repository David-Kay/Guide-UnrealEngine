UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) is a visual interface authoring tool in Unreal Engine that enables the creation of user interfaces (UI) and interactive elements for games and applications. It provides a user-friendly, node-based system for designing UI elements and connecting them to C++ code for functionality and interactivity.

You can read more about from the [docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/umg-ui-designer-for-unreal-engine/).

There is also a video about [UMG Widgets with C++ by Lively Geek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7v3UnL6PNU).

### UMG with C++

To control Blueprint-created widgets from C++ in Unreal Engine, you can use the `BindWidget` meta property. This powerful feature allows you to establish a connection between widgets created in the Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) editor and corresponding C++ variables.

By applying the `BindWidget` meta property to a C++ variable, you can establish the link between the widget and the variable, giving you direct access to the widget's properties and functionalities within your C++ code.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `BindWidget`:

```cpp
UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget)) // Binding via UMG editor
UTextBlock* PlayerDisplayNameText;
```

In this example, the `PlayerDisplayNameText` variable is declared as a `UTextBlock*` type, representing a text widget. The `meta=(BindWidget)` property indicates that this variable is bound to a widget created in the UMG editor.

With this binding in place, you can now access and control all the properties and functions of the `PlayerDisplayNameText` widget directly from your C++ code. This allows you to manipulate the widget's appearance, handle user interactions, and update its content dynamically based on game logic or user input.

Here's an example showcasing the usage of the widget:

```cpp
#include "MainMenu.h"

void UMainMenu::NativeConstruct()
{
    if (PlayerDisplayNameText == nullptr)
        return;

    PlayerDisplayNameText->OnClicked.AddDynamic(this, &UMainMenu::UpdatePlayerDisplayName);
}

void UMainMenu::UpdatePlayerDisplayName()
{
    if (PlayerDisplayNameText == nullptr)
        return;

    const FString& NewDisplayName = TEXT("John Doe");
    PlayerDisplayNameText->SetText(FText::FromString(NewDisplayName));
}
```

In this example, assume we have a custom player character class called `AMyPlayerCharacter`. The `UpdatePlayerDisplayName()` function receives a `NewDisplayName` as a parameter, which represents the updated display name for the player.

Inside the function, we check if the `PlayerDisplayNameText` widget is valid. If it is, we use the `SetText()` function to update the text displayed by the widget. In this case, we convert the `NewDisplayName` string to an FText object using `FText::FromString` before assigning it to the `PlayerDisplayNameText` widget.

### UI Tweening Library

[BenUI](https://benui.ca/) has also created a free helpful plugin, which helps you animate UMG in C++. Plugin can be install from github[^5]. [Link to repository](https://github.com/benui-dev/UE-BUITween).

Here's an example from UI Tweening Library:

```cpp
UBUITween::Create( SomeWidget, 0.2f )
	.FromTranslation( FVector2D( -100, 0 ) )
	.FromOpacity( 0.2f )
	.ToTranslation( FVector2D( 20, 10 ) )
	.ToOpacity( 1.0f )
	.Begin();
```
