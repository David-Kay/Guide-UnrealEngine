Subscribing and unsubscribing from a delegate allows you to add or remove event handlers (callbacks) to be executed when the delegate is broadcasted. In Unreal Engine, delegates are used to handle events and provide a way to react to various gameplay events or actions.

To subscribe to a delegate, you use the `AddDynamic` or `BindUFunction` method of the delegate. When subscribing using `AddDynamic`, you need to provide the UObject instance and the name of the function that will be called when the delegate is broadcasted. On the other hand, when using `BindUFunction`, you can directly bind a UFunction pointer to the delegate.

To unsubscribe from a delegate, you use the `RemoveDynamic` method. You need to provide the UObject instance and the name of the function that was previously subscribed. Similarly, if you used `BindUFunction`, you can use `RemoveDynamic` to remove the bound UFunction pointer from the delegate.

Here's an example of how to subscribe and unsubscribe from a delegate in Unreal Engine:

```cpp
// MyGameInstance.h

#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "Engine/GameInstance.h"
#include "MyGameInstance.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class YOURPROJECT_API UMyGameInstance : public UGameInstance
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Declare the delegate
    DECLARE_DELEGATE(FOnMyDelegate);

    // Subscribe to the delegate in BeginPlay
    virtual void Init() override;

    // Unsubscribe from the delegate in EndPlay
    virtual void Shutdown() override;

    // Broadcast the delegate when needed
    void BroadcastDelegate();

private:
    // The function that will be called when the delegate is broadcasted
    UFUNCTION()
    void HandleMyDelegate();
};
```

```cpp
// MyGameInstance.cpp

#include "MyGameInstance.h"

void UMyGameInstance::Init()
{
    Super::Init();

    // Subscribe to the delegate
    FOnMyDelegate& MyDelegate = FCoreDelegates::OnPreExit;
    MyDelegate.AddUObject(this, &UMyGameInstance::HandleMyDelegate);
}

void UMyGameInstance::Shutdown()
{
    // Unsubscribe from the delegate
    FOnMyDelegate& MyDelegate = FCoreDelegates::OnPreExit;
    MyDelegate.RemoveAll(this);
}

void UMyGameInstance::BroadcastDelegate()
{
    // Broadcast the delegate, which will call all subscribed event handlers
    FOnMyDelegate& MyDelegate = FCoreDelegates::OnPreExit;
    MyDelegate.Broadcast();
}

void UMyGameInstance::HandleMyDelegate()
{
    // This function will be called when the delegate is broadcasted
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("My delegate was called!"));
}
```
